## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Remove excess metadata columns
* Clean/standardize dream report text
* Merge related datasets and authors
* Rename datasets
* Remove entries with extreme word counts
* Remove datasets with small sample sizes

# Raw (original source) data

The SDDb source file comes from a [Zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18076716). See the description there for details on how the data was initially collected.

For older versions with less dream reports but more metadata (as columns), see access points mentioned in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/krank-sources/sddb/issues/1) and [./raw/compare.ipynb](./raw/compare.ipynb). The current version has 2 additional datasets and ~5k more dream reports than the previous versions, but again with less metadata.
